# SemiGenre

## About

The SemiGenre library provides a Python interface for tagging and comparing music in a personal audio library. The purpose of SemiGenre is primarily to discover structure in musical preferences through [semi-supervised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning) machine learning. Genres are not always the best way to talk about musical taste and SemiGenre aims to personalize the process of music recommendation with fine-grain analysis of musical clusters smaller than genres.

## Dependencies

In order to use the `semigenre.play` module you will need to install [VLC Media Player](https://download.cnet.com/VLC-Media-Player/3000-13632_4-10210434.html). The rest of the SemiGenre package will still work if you do not intend to use the SemiGenre media player.
